This section imports the necessary Python libraries for the script. math is a standard library for mathematical functions, 
torch is the PyTorch deep learning framework, os is a standard library for interfacing with the operating system, argparse is a
library for parsing command-line arguments, numpy is a library for numerical operations, itertools is a library for combinatorial 
operations, and tqdm is a library for displaying progress bars. The load_model and move_to functions are custom utilities defined in the 
utils module for loading models and moving data to GPU. The save_dataset function is another custom utility for saving datasets to disk. 
DataLoader is a PyTorch class for loading datasets, and time and timedelta are standard libraries for measuring time intervals. The 
parse_softmax_temperature function is another custom utility for parsing softmax temperatures from command-line arguments. Finally, 
mp is a context object for multiprocessing.




This function takes in several parameters:

sequences: a 3D numpy array of shape (n, m, k), where n is the number of solutions, m is the length of each solution, and k 
is the number of features for each element in the solution.
cost: a 1D numpy array of shape (n,), where each element is the cost of the corresponding solution in sequences.
ids (optional): a 1D numpy array of shape (n,), where each element is the ID of the instance that the corresponding solution belongs to. 
This is used to group the solutions by instance.
batch_size (optional): an integer that specifies the number of instances to return. If batch_size is None, all instances are returned.
The function first checks whether ids is None. If it is, it finds the index of the minimum cost solution and returns that solution and its 
cost as a 1-element list.

If ids is not None, the function splits the solutions by instance and finds the minimum cost solution for each instance. It then flattens the 
cost and ids arrays into 1D arrays and finds the index of the minimum cost solutions. The all_argmin array contains the indices of the minimum 
cost solutions, grouped by instance.

The function creates an array result of length len(group_lengths) (or batch_size, if specified), filled with -1. For each instance, the function 
sets the corresponding element in result to the index of the minimum cost solution for that instance. If batch_size is specified, the function 
returns a list of length batch_size with the corresponding solutions and costs. If batch_size is not specified, the function returns a list of 
length len(group_lengths) with the corresponding solutions and costs, padded with None and math.inf, respectively, if a solution was not found for
a particular instance.






This function is used to evaluate a dataset in parallel using multiple processes. It takes several arguments:

args: A tuple that contains the following elements:
dataset_path: The path to the dataset to be evaluated.
width: The beam width to use during decoding.
softmax_temp: The temperature to use during softmax calculation.
opts: An object that contains various options related to the evaluation process.
i: The index of the current process.
num_processes: The total number of processes being used for parallel evaluation.
The function first loads the trained model using the load_model function and then generates a validation dataset using the make_dataset method of 
the problem associated with the model. The val_size variable is set to the number of samples in the dataset divided by the number of processes,
and the offset is added to ensure that each process evaluates a unique subset of the dataset.

The function then creates a PyTorch device object corresponding to the current process's GPU, if available. Finally, it calls the _eval_dataset 
function to evaluate the dataset using the given model, beam width, softmax temperature, and device, and returns the result.




This function evaluates a TSP model on a given dataset. It takes four arguments:

dataset_path: a string representing the path to the dataset file
width: an integer representing the number of edges to consider during beam search
softmax_temp: a float representing the temperature for the softmax function used during decoding
opts: an object containing various options for the evaluation, such as model, val_size, offset, no_cuda, 
multiprocessing, eval_batch_size, decode_strategy, results_dir, o, f
The function first loads the TSP model using load_model() and checks whether or not to use multiprocessing to speed up the evaluation. 
If multiprocessing is used, it splits the dataset into equal parts for each available GPU and evaluates each part in parallel using eval_dataset_mp().
Otherwise, it evaluates the entire dataset on a single GPU using _eval_dataset().

The function then calculates statistics on the results, such as the average cost, serial and parallel durations, and the calculated total duration. 
It saves the results to a file with a specific naming convention that includes the dataset name, model name, decoding strategy, and other relevant 
information.

Finally, the function returns the costs, tours, and durations of the evaluation.




This is a function in Python that evaluates a given dataset using a specified model. Here is a summary of what it does:
The function takes as input a model, a dataset, a width (integer), a softmax temperature (float), some options (opts), and a device (string).
The function moves the model to the specified device and sets its mode to evaluation mode.
The function sets the decoding strategy of the model based on the provided options (either "greedy" or "sampling"), and sets the softmax temperature accordingly.
The function creates a DataLoader object from the dataset and loops through it.
For each batch in the DataLoader, the function moves the batch to the specified device and evaluates the model on the batch using the chosen decoding strategy.
If the decoding strategy is "sample" or "greedy", the function generates a specified number of sequences for each item in the batch using the model's sample_many method. If the decoding strategy is "bs" (beam search), the function performs beam search on the batch using the model's beam_search method.
The function then selects the best sequence for each item in the batch and adds the result to a list.
Finally, the function returns a list of tuples containing the cost, sequence, and duration for each item in the batch.
