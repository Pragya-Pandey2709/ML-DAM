This is a Python script that defines classes for different types of baselines in reinforcement learning.

The Baseline class is the base class for all baselines and contains several methods that must be implemented by its subclasses: wrap_dataset, 
unwrap_batch, eval, get_learnable_parameters, epoch_callback, state_dict, and load_state_dict.

The WarmupBaseline class is a subclass of Baseline that implements a warmup period during which a simpler baseline is used, gradually transitioning 
to a more complex baseline. It takes a baseline, n_epochs, and warmup_exp_beta as arguments. The wrap_dataset and unwrap_batch methods call the 
corresponding methods of the provided baseline if the warmup period has ended, otherwise they call the corresponding methods of an
ExponentialBaseline instance with a given beta value. The eval method returns a convex combination of the baseline and the loss, where 
the combination weight depends on the current epoch and the number of epochs for the warmup period. The epoch_callback method calls the
corresponding method of the provided baseline and sets the warmup alpha value. The state_dict and load_state_dict methods only save and 
load the state of the provided baseline.

The NoBaseline class is a subclass of Baseline that implements a baseline that always returns 0 for both value and loss.

The ExponentialBaseline class is a subclass of Baseline that implements a baseline that calculates the exponential moving average 
of the mean of the critic outputs. It takes a beta value as an argument. The eval method returns the current value and 0 for the loss.
The state_dict and load_state_dict methods only save and load the current value.

The CriticBaseline class is a subclass of Baseline that implements a baseline that uses a critic network to estimate the value of the state. 
It takes a critic network as an argument. The eval method returns the critic output and the mean squared error loss between the critic output 
and the weighted sum of the critic outputs for the current and the previous state. The get_learnable_parameters method returns the critic network 
parameters. The epoch_callback method does nothing. The state_dict and load_state_dict methods save and load the critic network state.

The RolloutBaseline class is a subclass of Baseline that implements a baseline that uses rollout to estimate the value of the state. It takes a 
model, a problem instance, and an options instance as arguments. The eval method returns the value obtained by rolling out the model and the
mean squared error loss between the value and the weighted sum of the values for the current and the previous state. The get_learnable_parameters 
method returns an empty list. The epoch_callback method updates the model and generates a baseline dataset. The state_dict and load_state_dict methods 
save and load the model state.
