Reptile is a meta-learning algorithm that utilizes the Shortest Descent algorithm for updating initial parameters towards the final parameters 
learned on a specific task. The algorithm involves repeatedly sampling a task, performing stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on it, and updating the 
initial parameters in the direction of the final parameters obtained from that task.

The algorithm starts with an initial set of parameters, which are then used to train a model on a task sampled from a set of tasks. The model is 
updated using SGD, a commonly used optimization technique, to minimize the loss on the sampled task. After a few iterations of SGD, the updated
parameters are considered as the final parameters learned for that task. The initial parameters are then updated towards these final parameters 
by taking a small step in their direction. This process is repeated for multiple tasks, with the initial parameters being updated incrementally 
after each task.

The Shortest Descent algorithm, on which Reptile is based, is a form of first-order meta-learning, where the model is updated directly based on the 
final parameters learned from each task. This is in contrast to higher-order meta-learning algorithms, such as the well-known MAML (Model-Agnostic 
Meta-Learning), which require computing higher-order derivatives and can be computationally expensive.

Reptile only requires black-box access to an optimizer, such as SGD or Adam, which makes it computationally efficient and easy to implement. It is 
mathematically similar to first-order MAML, but with a more straightforward update rule based on the Shortest Descent algorithm. Despite its simplicity, 
Reptile has been shown to achieve competitive performance in various meta-learning tasks, making it a promising approach for efficient and effective 
meta-learning.
